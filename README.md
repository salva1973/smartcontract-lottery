# Smart Contract Lottery

1. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner

How do we want to test this?

1. `mainnet-fork` (only onchain contract with some math)
2. `development` with mocks
3. `testnet`
